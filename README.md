# Single_Actuator_Wave-like_robot

The idea of this robot is inspired by Single Actuator Wave-like robot

http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1748-3190/11/4/046004

I think this structure is quite interesting and try to build my own version of the SAW robot.

All the STL files of the 3D models of the robot attached here. Please use a 3D printer to print them and note that the helix should be printed with dissolved support due to its complicated structure.

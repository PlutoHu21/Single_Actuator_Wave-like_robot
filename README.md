# Single_Actuator_Wave-like_robot

The idea of this robot is inspired by Single Actuator Wave-like robot

I think this structure is quite interesting and try to build my own version of the SAW robot.

I developed my own version of the Single Actuator Wave-like robot, a bioinspired crawling robot capable of advancing through wave-like locomotion. The robot has a clever minimalistic mechanical design, where the connected links in series form an advancing wave with the rotating helix driven by a single motor. The kinematic models of the robot are established for the calculation of the velocity and the analysis of crawling in different environments. The experiments around the robot were conducted to explore the crawling abilities of the robot when interacting with different environments. The results demonstrated the robot's potential to crawl in diverse environments, especially in soft tube. Therefore, the robot could be viewed as a potential robot candidate for medical application in the biological vessels in the human body. In addition, I attempted to build a reconfigurable version of the robots but failed.

All the STL files of the 3D models of the robot are attached here. Please use a 3D printer to print them and note that the helix should be printed with dissolved support due to its complicated structure.
